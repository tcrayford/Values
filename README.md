Values is a tiny library for creating value objects in ruby.
These mostly look like classes created using Struct, but fix two problems with those:

Struct constructors can take less than the default number of arguments and set other fields as nil:

    Point = Struct.new(:x,:y)
    Point.new(1)
    => #<struct Point x=1, y=nil>

Structs are also mutable:

    Point = Struct.new(:x,:y)
    p = Point.new(1,2)
    p.x = 2
    p.x
    => 2

Values fixes both of these:

    Point = Value.new(:x, :y)
    Point.new(1)
    => ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments, 1 for 2
    from /Users/tcrayford/Projects/ruby/values/lib/values.rb:7:in `block (2 levels) in new
    from (irb):5:in new
    from (irb):5
    from /usr/local/bin/irb:12:in `<main>

    p = Point.new(1,2)
    p.x = 1
    => NoMethodError: undefined method x= for #<Point:0x00000100943788 @x=0, @y=1>
    from (irb):6
    from /usr/local/bin/irb:12:in <main>

Value does NOT have all the features of Struct (nor is it meant to).
